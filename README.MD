# When The Clouds Separate Digital Exhibit
A virtual art exhibit based off of my final portfolio in Digital Imaging I.
You can interact with my different photos for the project as well as see the photos in a virtual gallery.

## Dependencies:
This program is built in Unity with Oculus Rift Integration. You should just be able to run the Unity build like any other Unity Game. It depends on you being able to grab things with the Oculus controllers. You can walk around using the joystick if you don’t have a ton of space to work with. Right now, I’ve only built it on Windows (I don’t have a Mac).

## How to Play:
You can pick up different photo shapes and hold them in your left or your right hand using the Oculus Rift headset. The controls are L Touch and R Touch for the left and right hands respectively. You can also press escape to exit the game. There's a menu at the start that you can click through. I don't have any settings right now. You can exit the game from the start menu too.

## Tools
For this project I used:
## DoozyUI
## Some photos that I took
## 3DFrk's "Picture Frames with photos"
## Oculus Integration
## TextMeshPro
## DoTween
## Standard Assets

## Background:
This project “When the Clouds Separate” is based on an ongoing photography project that I’m doing based on my experiences with Christianity, and Christianity’s conflicts with race, and the War on Drugs. The context of the project is that even in Christianity, where the end goal is the same place (Heaven), there still isn’t equality and Black churches and white churches don’t operate the same way. Many Black Americans don’t feel safe in churches, as they’ve historically been targeted for shootings and bombings by white supremacists. In my home church, they lock the doors and my deacons now carry weapons. In a sense, this project is like an interactive virtual art exhibit. I thought it was kind of cool in our class, how we got to see some other groups building things like virtual museums and stereogram setups. I think VR’s a good medium to show artwork, because VR is already artwork in itself.
