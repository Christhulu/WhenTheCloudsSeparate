# When The Clouds Separate Digital Exhibit

A virtual art exhibit based off of my final portfolio in Digital Imaging I.


## Dependencies:
This program is built in Unity with Oculus Rift Integration. You should just be able to run the Unity build like any other Unity Game. It depends on you being able to grab things with the Oculus controllers. You can walk around using the joystick if you don’t have a ton of space to work with. Right now, I’ve only built it on Windows (I don’t have a Mac).

## Tools
For this project I used:
## DoozyUI
## Volumetric Lighting and Fog
## Oculus Integration

## Background:
This project “When the Clouds Separate” is based on an ongoing photography project that I’m doing based on my experiences with Christianity, and Christianity’s conflicts with race, and the War on Drugs. The context of the project is that even in Christianity, where the end goal is the same place (Heaven), there still isn’t equality and Black churches and white churches don’t operate the same way. Many Black Americans don’t feel safe in churches, as they’ve historically been targeted for shootings and bombings by white supremacists. In my home church, they lock the doors and my deacons now carry weapons. In a sense, this project is like an interactive virtual art exhibit. I thought it was kind of cool in our class, how we got to see some other groups building things like virtual museums and stereogram setups. I think VR’s a good medium to show artwork, because VR is already artwork in itself.

##Music
